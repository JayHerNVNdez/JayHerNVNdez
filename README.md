I am a recent graduate of a cyberboot camp, with prior hardware training and schooling, transitioning from a 7 year teaching career.

## Objective

Growing with technology, and advancing with it in my life created a passion for tech. Finance work allowed me to see the ease with which info is stolen and I now want to help protect info, people, and intellectual property from those who want to take it, in any field with information protection, detection, as a Tier 1 Analyst.
